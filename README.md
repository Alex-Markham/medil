## MeDIL
MeDIL is a Python package for causal modeling, originally focusing on the measurement dependence inducing latent (MeDIL) causal model framework[<sup>1</sup>](#uai_paper), but now including more general methods for causal discovery and inference.

More information can be found in the [documentation](https://medil.causal.dev).
