* very easy basic use
** NCFA:
#+begin_src python
  from medil import ncfa

  model = ncfa.fit(your_data)
#+end_src
** or optionally set a structure to perform confirmatory factor analysis (either add the line ncfa.biadj = biadj before fitting? or just put this in the tutorial using the MCM object)
** above is a high-level wrapper with presets for NCFA, but the model can be customized (e.g., to use simple Gaussian model, or to perform confirmatory factor analysis): See API for more details
#+begin_src python
  from medil import MedilCausalModel

  model = MedilCausalModel(set params...)
  model.fit(your_data)
#+end_src
