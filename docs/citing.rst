Citing
======

If you make use of the ``MeDIL`` package in connection with MeDIL causal models, please cite our UAI paper :cite:`Markham_2020_UAI`, e.g., using the following ``bibtex`` code:

.. code-block:: bibtex

   @Article{Markham_2020_UAI,
     author       = {Markham, Alex and Grosse-Wentrup, Moritz},
     title        = {Measurement Dependence Inducing Latent Causal Models},
     year         = 2020,
     issn         = {2640-3498},
     url          = {http://www.auai.org/uai2020/proceedings/244_main_paper.pdf},
     journal      = {Conference on Uncertainty in Artificial Intelligence (UAI)},
     publisher    = {PMLR}
   }


Additionally (or alternatively, if you only use the package in ways unrelated to the MeDIL causal modelling framework, e.g., for independence testing or finding edge clique covers), please cite our PGM software demonstration paper :cite:`Markham_2020_PGM`:

.. code-block:: bibtex

   @Article{Markham_2020_PGM,
     author       = {Markham, Alex, and Chivukula, Aditya and Grosse-Wentrup, Moritz},
     title        = {MeDIL: A Python Package for Causal Modelling},
     year         = 2020,
     issn         = {2640-3498},
     journal      = {International Conference on Probabilistic Graphical Models (PGM) Software Demonstration},
     publisher    = {PMLR}
   }
